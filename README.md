This project is showing how you can use Angular 4 with Office.js to build an Excel add-in.

## How to run

1.
    On Windows, follow [this tutorial](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins).

    On macOS, copy the manifest file `angular-office-add-in-manifest.xml` to the folder `/Users/{username}/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/wef` (if not exist, create one)

2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

3. Open Excel and click the Add-in.

## How to create a new project by yourself

Two parts:

- The Angular project is generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

- The manifest file is generated by [YO Office](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office). When you generate, choose to only generate the manifest file.
Then change the port in the generated manifest file from `3000` to `4200`.
